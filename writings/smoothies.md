# Smoothie recipes

Take the ingredients listed and put them in a high powered blender (I
use a [Blendtec Pro
800](https://www.blendtec.com/products/professional-800)).  Blend
until you like the consistency.  A minute is likely sufficient.

## Good

### Green banana and vanilla

* Avocado.

* Banana.

* Plenty of spinach.

* Vanilla soy milk.

Use maple syrup to adjust the sweetness to preference, but is quite
tasty even when not very sweet.

### Exotic dried fruit and also banana

* Dried papaya and pineapple (I used an "exotic fruit mix" from the supermarket).

* Vanilla soy milk.

* A banana.

Extremely sweet.

### Rhubarb and strawberries

* Fresh strawberries

* Fresh rhubarb cut into dices

Somewhat tart.  Add maple syrup to add a bit of sweetness if you wish,
but not too much.  The rhubarb is the point.

## Decent

### Papaya, mango, and pineapple juice

* Papaya

* Mango

* Pineapple juice

* Some ice cubes

Make sure you use sufficient ice cubes and/or juice to make it fairly
liquid.  Not particularly sweet, but decently refreshing.

### Papaya and banana

* Half a papaya.

* A banana.

* Vanilla soy milk.

* Ice cubes.

Not as sweet as expected.  Very fresh.

### Vanilla soy milk orange

* One peeled large orange or several small ones.

* Vanilla soy milk.

* A generous teaspoon of honey.

* Some ice cubes.

I think it's OK, but my partner says it "tastes like disease" (and she
works at a hospital, so I guess she'd know).

### Blackberry, pineapple, kiwi, and passion fruit

* Passion fruits without the rinds.

* Some blackberries.

* A couple of peeled kiwis.

* Pineapple juice.

Tastes a bit like red berry juice, but with the spiciness of kiwis.
*Way* too many seeds.

### Cucumber and spinach

* A couple of Kiwi

* Half a cucumber

* Lots of spinach

* Pineapple juice

Not very sweet, but an acceptable way to ingest lots of vegetables.
The kiwis help make the taste more interesting.

### Grapefruit yogurt

* Grapefruit

* Orange

* Two dollops of Greek yoghurt

* Some maple syrup

Both sweet and bitter.  Probably better without the grapefruit.

## Awful

### Grapefruit spinach

* A peeled grapefruit.

* Two handfuls of spinach.

* Some apple juice.

* A bit of soy milk, just to thin it further.

* Ice cubes.

* A banana.

Much more bitter than I expected.

### Orange with peel

* A large un-peeled orange.  Make sure to wash it first, as they are
  often surface treated with conservation chemicals.

* That's it.

Produces a disgusting chunky high-viscosity jelly.  Probably
impossible to actually drink.  If you blend in some water (or
presumably ice cubes) it may become possible to drink, but you still
don't want to.  Awful taste and awful texture.  Don't think you can
make orange juice this way.
