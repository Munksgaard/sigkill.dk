# Smoothie recipes

Take the ingredients listed and put them in a high powered blender (I
use a [Blendtec Pro
800](https://www.blendtec.com/products/professional-800)).  Blend
until you like the consistency.  A minute is likely sufficient.

## Good

TBA

## Decent

### Vanilla soy milk orange

* One peeled large orange or several small ones.

* Vanilla soy milk.

* A generous teaspoon of honey.

* Some ice cubes.

I think it's OK, but my partner says it "tastes like disease" (and she
works at a hospital, so I guess she'd know).

### Blackberry, pineapple, kiwi, and passion fruit

* Passion fruits without the rinds.

* Some blackberries.

* A couple of peeled kiwis.

* Pineapple juice.

Tastes a bit like red berry juice, but with the spiciness of kiwis.
*Way* too many seeds.

## Awful

### Orange with peel

* A large un-peeled orange.  Make sure to wash it first, as they are
  often surface treated with convervation chemicals.

* That's it.

Produces a disgusting chunky high-viscosity jelly.  Probably
impossible to actually drink.  If you blend in some water (or
presumably ice cubes) it may become possible to drink, but you still
don't want to.  Awful taste and awful texture.  Don't think you can
make orange juice this way.
